Hi! Iâ€™m a journalist at The Verge. I cover technology, gaming, and more.

Below are select highlights of my work. You can see all of my writing for The Verge on [my author page](https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters). On Bluesky, I'm [@jaypeters.net](https://bsky.app/profile/jaypeters.net).

## Other Stuff

</ul>

### A Treat For Reading This Far
In 2010, I played bass drum for the University of Oregon Marching Band and nearly ran over a camera person [at the Rose Bowl](https://youtu.be/cy0gmKbine8?feature=shared&t=54).
