### Previous Jobs
Before The Verge, I worked at [Techmeme](https://techmeme.com) and [WE Communications](https://www.we-worldwide.com).

## Other Stuff

### Emoji
I drafted emoji proposals for:

ðŸ«¡ Saluting Face <br>
ðŸ«§ Bubbles <br>
ðŸ§‡ Waffle <br>
ðŸ¥± Yawning Face <br>

You can find my proposals on [the Unicode Consortium's website]([url](https://www.unicode.org/emoji/charts/emoji-proposals.html)). I also wrote a story for The Verge about [how I made the yawning face and waffle emoji]([url](https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode)).

### Running
I like to run long distances and have completed four marathons: the 2023 and 2021 Portland Marathon and the 2017 and 2012 Rock â€˜nâ€™ Roll Seattle Marathon. My times weren't great; I prefer to run far, not fast.

### A Treat For Reading This Far
In 2010, I played bass drum for the University of Oregon Marching Band and nearly ran over a camera person [during our Rose Bowl halftime performance]([url](https://youtu.be/cy0gmKbine8?feature=shared&t=54)).
